            <h1>Welcome, early puzzle solver.</h1>
            <p>Since you cracked the puzzle in the first email, here are some hints to the website puzzles.</p>
            <p>The goal of the puzzles is to find Alex's passwords and login to the website as him.</p>
            <p>All puzzle events are controlled by a Lunacy or Sanity scale displayed in the Javascript Console, and a warning pops up at high lunacy or low sanity, but the passwords will also be most visible then.</p>
            <p>Try clicking on buttons, interact with Alex's stuff, or just read the newsletter and see what happens.</p>
            <p>Good Luck!</p>
